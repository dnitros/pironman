# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`              | `needs-triage`        | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue   |
| `needs-info`                | `needs-info`          | Waiting on reporter for more information  |
| `ready-for-agent`           | `ready-for-agent`     | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent   |
| `ready-for-human`           | `ready-for-human`     | Requires human implementation             |
| `wontfix`                   | `wontfix`             | Will not be actioned                      |

None of these exist as Linear labels yet for team Personal. They get created on first use via `mcp__linear-server__create_issue_label`, then applied via `save_issue`.

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
